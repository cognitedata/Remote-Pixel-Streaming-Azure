# Getting started with Cognite Remote

### Setup
The Cognite Remote application is based on Unreal Engine 4, and requires certain libraries to be installed on your computer to work correctly. 
These libraries can be installed by running the Unreal Engine prerequisite installer found in this folder: Engine\Extras\Redist\en-us\UE4PrereqSetup_x64.exe

### Logging in
To log in, you need to enter the name of the Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) project on the login screen. This often corresponds to the name of your company.
Clicking continue will take you to the login portal for the specific CDF project.
Some CDF projects have their own CDF environment, and in order to log in to such projects you need to input the CDF environment in the advanced options.
In addition to the standard login portal we also support logging in using an API key. 
This can be done using the advanced options on the loing screen, but we recommend only using this if strictly necessary.

### Time zones
The advanced options in the login screen allows you to select a time zone for the application. 
All time stamps in the application (including time series values) will be displayed using the selected time zone.
